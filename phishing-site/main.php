        <p>
            If you've recognized a phishing email, <strong>do not</strong> click on any links in the email.
            It's generally good practice for all emails to type the link out manually rather
            than click. The display text has no bearing on where the link actually goes, and many
            don't actually look at where the hyperlink will open to.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've included a form on this website for you to submit examples of 
            spam or phishing emails and an extension for Google Chrome to highlight examples
            of phishing emails in your Outlook email, so that you won't be fooled by the same
            email twice.
